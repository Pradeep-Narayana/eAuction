An online auction platform where users can place blind bids to buy the displayed items or add an item to sell in the auction.

This project consists of two users - Buyer and a Seller.
A user can act as both a buyer and a seller. The user can view all the items available to buy on the home screen.
The user can place a blind bid on any item of their choice and also has the provision to post any item to sell.

It consists of a home screen where the user can see various items that are up for auction and also the items that the user has put up for sale.
If the user is interested in buying any of the item, they can click on the item which opens a bid screen consisting of the item details such as name, description, image, and a field to enter the bid amount. The user places a blind bid on the item and waits for the auction to end.
This is a time based auction and once the time limit is reached, the user who had placed the highest bid on that item will win it and all users will be notified about this.

If the user is interested in selling an item, they have a separate screen to add the item details and the minimum bid expected for the item.
Once the item has been added, all the interested buyers would be able to place the blind bids and the item will be sold at the end of the auction.
